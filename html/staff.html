        <h2>Dr. Cassia Varek</h2>
        <p><strong>Archaeologist (specialty: Ancient Urban Settlements)</strong><br>
        Dr. Cassia Varek earned her PhD in Archaeology from the University of Edinburgh, studying under renowned excavation expert Dr. Samuel Moen. She specializes in ancient urban settlements, particularly those in arid desert climates. Her skills include stratigraphy analysis, digital site modeling, and excavation logistics. She frequently uses drone photography and LIDAR scanning to map lost cities buried beneath sand. With a meticulous yet bold approach to research, she’s known for her creative thinking in the field. She is curating a new exhibit on “Buried Cities: Life in Forgotten Deserts,” combining findings from her latest digs with interactive digital models. Cassia received the Royal Explorers Fellowship and is fluent in Arabic and Greek, which helps her connect with local teams and decipher inscriptions on-site.</p>

        <h2>Prof. Keon Ihalani</h2>
        <p><strong>Physical Anthropologist (specialty: Burial Rituals & Bone Analysis)</strong><br>
        Professor Keon Ihalani holds a dual PhD in Anthropology and Forensic Science from the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa. He investigates burial sites to understand ancient social structures and death rituals. His strengths include forensic reconstruction, isotope analysis, and digital bone modeling. He often uses 3D scanners and imaging software to recreate skeletal remains in digital format. Calm and detail-oriented, he balances tradition with technology in his lab work. Keon leads the museum’s Human Traces Initiative, which reconstructs ancient lives through remains and tells their stories respectfully and accurately. He is an advocate for indigenous consultation in archaeological digs and often works with descendant communities to co-curate exhibits.</p>

        <h2>Lira M. Soryan</h2>
        <p><strong>Mythographer & Symbolic Analyst</strong><br>
        Lira M. Soryan studied Comparative Mythology and Semiotics at the Sorbonne and later completed a fellowship in Indigenous Storywork at the Smithsonian. Passionate about symbolism in pre-literate societies, they focus on how myths encode memory, power, and survival. Their past work includes reinterpreting artifacts from matriarchal Bronze Age cultures through a feminist semiotic lens. Dreamy yet rigorous, Lira collaborates with artists to bring museum stories to life. Lira combines AI-assisted symbolic comparison, oral histories from cultural memory holders, and cross-civilizational myth analysis. They create immersive storytelling rooms that blend light, sound, and narrative. Lira openly challenges colonial museum narratives and often sparks debate with Group A researchers by centering alternate cultural viewpoints. They’re also multilingual and advocate for repatriation efforts.</p>
